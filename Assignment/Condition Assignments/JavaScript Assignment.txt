1.   What is JavaScript?
Ans. JavaScript is a Scripting Programming Language.

2.   Who developed JavaScript, and what is the first name of JavaScript?
Ans. JavaScript was invented and developed by Brendan Eich in 1995.
     First name of JavaScript is MOCHA.

3.   Are ECMAScript and javascript related? How?
Ans. JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
     The ECMAScript specification is a blueprint for creating a scripting language. 
     JavaScript is an implementation of that blueprint. 
     JavaScript implements the ECMAScript specification as described in ECMA-262.
 
4.   Is JavaScript case-sensitive?
Ans. Yes.

5.   What are the different data types present in javascript?
Ans. Primitive Data  Type and Non-Primitive Data Type.
	1. String 		1. Object
	2. Number		i> Array
	3. Boolean		ii>Object
	4. Undefined
	5. Null
	6. BigInt
	7. Symbol

6.   What do you mean by NULL in JavaScript?
Ans. In JavaScript, Null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value.

7.   What do you mean by undefined value in JavaScript?
Ans. In JavaScript, Undefined value is a variable that has not been assigned a value.

8.   Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
Ans. 1> "==" is an Equality Operator. 			1> "===" is a Strict Equality Operator.  
     2> "==" used for comparing two variables. 		2> "===" used for comparing two variables.
     3> It ignores the data type of variable.		3> It checks data type of variables and compares two values.
     4> Checks the equality of two operands 		4> Compares equality of two operands with their types.   
        without considering their type.			 				   
     
9.   What do you mean by the “===” operator?
Ans. "===" is a Strict Equality Operator. It checks data type of variables and compares two values. 
     Compares equality of two operands with their types.

10.  Difference between var and let keyword in javascript?
Ans. The 'var' keyword has a global scope. The 'let' keyword stays limited to the block scope.

11.  Explain Implicit Type coercion in javascript?
Ans. Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. 
     This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. 
     when different types of operators are applied to the values.

12.  What is NaN property in JavaScript?
Ans. The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.

13.  What Should be the answer of 10+2+“77”?
Ans. '1277'.

14.  What is the use of the delete operator?
Ans. The delete operator removes a given property from an object. 

15.  What do you mean by Escape characters?
Ans. Escape Characters are the symbol used to begin an escape command in order to execute some operation. 
     They are characters that can be interpreted in some alternate way than what we intended to.

16.  Name all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
Ans. Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

17.  What do you mean by Cookies JavaScript?
Ans. A cookie is an amount of information that persists between a server-side and a client-side. 
     A web browser stores this information at the time of browsing.
     A cookie contains the information as a string generally in the form of a name-value pair separated by semi-colons.

18.  How should we create a cookie in JavaScript?
Ans. JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.
     Ex: document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

19.  How can you read a cookie in JavaScript?
Ans. let x = document.cookie;
     document.cookie will return all cookies in one string much like: cookie1=value; cookie2=value; cookie3=value;

20.  What is DOM?
Ans. "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to 
      dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

21.  What is the difference between Do-While and While Loop?
Ans. A while loop checks the condition, then executes the loop. A Do-While executes the loop and then checks the conditions.

22.  How does the Do-While loop work?
Ans. The do-while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false.

23.  How does the For-Loop work?
Ans. A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

24.  Is it possible to skip or omit parts of the for-loop settings?
Ans. The continue statement (with or without a label reference) can only be used to skip one loop iteration.

25.  Can you stop a loop based on a specific condition?
Ans. The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it is encountered.

26.  What is the difference between the break statement and the continue directive?
Ans. The break statement "jumps out" of a loop. The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
     Break statement stops the entire process of the loop. Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop.
